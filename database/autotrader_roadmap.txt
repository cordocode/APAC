CLEAR NEXT-ACTIONS ROADMAP (UPDATED MAY 31, 2025)

Read this one breath at a time—finish the current line before looking at the next.

database/stocks.db is db location!!

-----------------------------------------------------------------

COMPLETED STEPS (1-10):

1. CREATE THE PROJECT SKELETON ✅
2. DROP IN `db_manager.py` AND WRITE `initialize_database()` ✅
3. ADD THE HELPER THAT GROWS COLUMNS AUTOMATICALLY ✅
4. SMOKE-TEST WHAT YOU HAVE ✅
5. COMPLETE THE CORE DATABASE FUNCTIONS ✅
   - Added check_data_exists() function that was missing
   - All functions tested and working
6. TEST YOUR DATABASE FUNCTIONS ✅
   - Created comprehensive test suite
   - All tests passing
7. WRITE THE `HistoricalFetcher` CLASS ✅
   - CRITICAL FIX: Now explicitly sets market hours to get minute bars
   - Successfully fetches ~390 bars per day
8. CONFIRM THE BACKFILL PATH ✅
   - Tested with multiple tickers and date ranges
   - Handles weekends/holidays correctly
9. BUILD THE `RealtimeStreamer` CLASS ✅
   - WebSocket connection working
   - Successfully stores real-time data
10. RUN LIVE TESTS ✅
    - Both historical and real-time data flowing correctly
    - Database is production-ready

-----------------------------------------------------------------

NEXT STEPS (You are here → Step 11):

11. BUILD REST API ENDPOINTS
    - What to do: Create `api_endpoints.py` using FastAPI or Flask
    - Endpoints needed:
      * GET /data/{ticker}/{start}/{end} - Return historical data
      * GET /latest/{ticker} - Get latest price
      * POST /subscribe/{ticker} - Add ticker to websocket
      * GET /status - Check system health
    - Why: Algorithms need a clean API to request data without touching DB directly

12. CREATE ALGORITHM FRAMEWORK
    - What to do: New folder `algorithms/` with base class `BaseAlgorithm`
    - Base class should have:
      * initialize() - Set up algorithm state
      * on_data(ticker, bar) - Process new data
      * get_signals() - Return buy/sell signals
      * backtest(start, end) - Test on historical data
    - Why: Standard interface for all trading strategies

13. BUILD YOUR FIRST ALGORITHM
    - What to do: Simple moving average crossover in `algorithms/sma_cross.py`
    - Use 20-period and 50-period SMAs
    - Generate buy signal when 20 crosses above 50
    - Generate sell signal when 20 crosses below 50
    - Why: Proves the framework works with a classic strategy

14. ADD PAPER TRADING INTEGRATION
    - What to do: Create `paper_trader.py` that:
      * Connects to Alpaca paper trading API
      * Listens to algorithm signals
      * Places paper trades
      * Tracks positions and P&L
    - Why: Test strategies with fake money before going live

15. IMPLEMENT MONITORING & LOGGING
    - What to do: Add proper logging throughout the system
    - Create `monitor.py` that tracks:
      * Database size and performance
      * API request counts
      * WebSocket connection status
      * Algorithm performance metrics
    - Why: You need visibility into what's happening

16. BUILD SIMPLE WEB DASHBOARD
    - What to do: Basic web UI to:
      * View current positions
      * See algorithm signals
      * Monitor system health
      * Start/stop algorithms
    - Use Flask + basic HTML/JS (no need for React yet)
    - Why: Visual interface beats command line for monitoring

17. ADD CRASH RECOVERY
    - What to do: Implement:
      * Automatic reconnection for websocket
      * State persistence for algorithms
      * Graceful shutdown handlers
      * Startup integrity checks
    - Why: System needs to handle failures gracefully

18. DEPLOY TO CLOUD (OPTIONAL)
    - What to do: Deploy to AWS EC2 or DigitalOcean
    - Set up systemd services for each component
    - Configure backups for database
    - Why: Run 24/7 without your laptop

REMEMBER:
- Database layer is DONE and working perfectly
- All timestamps are UTC (displayed as YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ)
- Missing 4:00 PM bars is a known issue (not worth fixing now)
- System handles weekends/holidays automatically
- When testing, use dates in the past to avoid 15-min delay issues

CURRENT SYSTEM CAPABILITIES:
✅ Fetch any historical data from 2018 onwards
✅ Store minute-by-minute price data
✅ Stream real-time data during market hours
✅ Automatically manage new tickers
✅ Handle thousands of requests efficiently

Your database foundation is rock solid. Time to build the trading logic on top!
