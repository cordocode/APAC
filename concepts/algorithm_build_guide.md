## üéØ System Overview

AutoTrader is a Raspberry Pi-based automated trading system that:
- Executes trading algorithms every minute during market hours (at :02 seconds past)
- Uses Alpaca API for trade execution and market data
- Maintains a market-hours-only database with historical data from 2018-2028
- Supports multiple concurrent algorithms with isolated capital allocations
- Provides real-time WebSocket data feeds for active algorithms

### Key Design Principles
1. **Market-Hours-Only**: Every timestamp in the database is a valid trading minute
2. **Self-Contained Algorithms**: Each algorithm manages its own data and state
3. **Zero Calendar Logic**: Algorithms never worry about weekends/holidays
4. **Stateless Design**: All state is derived from transaction history
5. **UTC Everywhere**: All timestamps use 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ' format

## üìä Data Access Capabilities

### What Data You Can Access

#### 1. Historical Minute Bars (2018-2028)
```python
# Get last N bars before a timestamp
bars = get_data_for_algorithm(
    ticker=self.ticker,
    requirement_type='last_n_bars',
    n=200,  # Returns exactly 200 market minutes
    before_timestamp=current_time  # Optional, defaults to now
)

# Get specific time range
bars = get_data_for_algorithm(
    ticker=self.ticker,
    requirement_type='time_range',
    start='2024-01-02T09:30:00Z',
    end='2024-01-02T16:00:00Z'
)
```

#### 2. Bar Data Structure
Each bar contains:
```python
{
    'timestamp': '2024-03-15T19:59:00Z',
    'ohlcv': {
        'o': 416.305,  # Open
        'h': 416.67,   # High  
        'l': 416.28,   # Low
        'c': 416.52,   # Close
        'v': 12449     # Volume
    }
}
```

#### 3. Transaction History
```python
transactions = get_transactions(algo_id)
# Returns list of dicts with: type, shares, price, timestamp
```

#### 4. Algorithm Configuration (Provided by System)
The system automatically provides your algorithm with:
- **initial_capital**: Set when algorithm instance is created (stored in system_db)
- **ticker**: The stock symbol this instance trades
- **algo_id**: Unique identifier for this algorithm instance

You DON'T need to query the system database directly - the orchestrator passes these values to your algorithm's `__init__` and `run` methods.

### Data Limitations
- **No tick data** - Only minute bars
- **No pre/after market** - Regular hours only (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)
- **No options/futures** - Stocks only
- **No fundamental data** - Price/volume only
- **No real-time quotes** - Last minute bar only
- **Auto-fetch on missing data** - System fetches from Alpaca if data not in database

### Database Separation
- **stocks.db**: Contains all price/volume data (accessed via `get_data_for_algorithm`)
- **system.db**: Contains algorithm configuration and transactions
  - Your `initial_capital` is stored here but provided to you via `__init__`
  - You only query this for transaction history via `get_transactions(algo_id)`

---

## üí∞ Trading Capabilities

### What You CAN Do
- **Market orders only** (buy/sell at current market price)
- **Any share quantity** (limited by available capital)
- **Long positions only** (no shorting)
- **Multiple positions** per algorithm
- **Partial positions** (can buy/sell in increments)

### What You CANNOT Do
- ‚ùå Limit orders
- ‚ùå Stop losses (must implement in algorithm logic)
- ‚ùå Options/futures
- ‚ùå Short selling
- ‚ùå Pre/after market trading
- ‚ùå Fractional shares
- ‚ùå Multiple tickers per algorithm instance

---

## üîÑ System Data Flow

### How Your Algorithm Gets Its Configuration

When the orchestrator runs your algorithm:

1. **System reads from `algorithm_instances` table**:
   - Loads algorithm type, ticker, initial_capital, and status
   - Creates an instance: `algo = Algorithm(ticker='AAPL', initial_capital=10000.0)`

2. **System passes data to your algorithm**:
   - `__init__`: Receives ticker and initial_capital from database
   - `run()`: Receives current_time and algo_id for transaction lookups

3. **Your algorithm uses**:
   - `self.ticker` and `self.initial_capital` (provided by system)
   - `get_transactions(algo_id)` to see trading history
   - `get_data_for_algorithm()` for market data

**Key Point**: You never need to query the system database directly. The orchestrator handles all algorithm instance management and provides everything you need through method parameters.

## üîß Algorithm Interface Requirements

### MANDATORY Structure
Every algorithm MUST follow this exact structure:

```python
from database.db_manager import get_data_for_algorithm
from system_databse.system_db_manager import get_transactions

class Algorithm:
    def __init__(self, ticker, initial_capital):
        """
        REQUIRED: These exact parameter names
        
        Args:
            ticker: Stock symbol (e.g., 'AAPL')
            initial_capital: Allocated capital in dollars
        """
        self.ticker = ticker
        self.initial_capital = initial_capital
        # Add your strategy parameters here
        
    def run(self, current_time, algo_id):
        """
        REQUIRED: This exact method signature
        
        Args:
            current_time: UTC timestamp string (e.g., '2024-03-15T20:02:00Z')
            algo_id: Database ID for this algorithm instance
            
        Returns:
            tuple: MUST return exactly ('action', shares) where:
                   - action is exactly 'buy', 'sell', or 'hold' (lowercase)
                   - shares is an integer (0 for hold)
        """
        # Your strategy logic here
        return ('hold', 0)  # MUST return this exact format
```

### Import Requirements
```python
# REQUIRED imports (note the typo in system_databse is intentional!)
from database.db_manager import get_data_for_algorithm
from system_databse.system_db_manager import get_transactions

# You do NOT need to import functions to read algorithm_instances
# The system provides initial_capital and ticker through __init__ parameters

# Optional common imports
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import logging
```

---

## üìà Common Algorithm Patterns

### Position Tracking Pattern
```python
# Calculate current position from transaction history
transactions = get_transactions(algo_id)
current_shares = sum(tx['shares'] if tx['type'] == 'buy' else -tx['shares'] 
                    for tx in transactions)

# Calculate invested capital
net_cash_used = sum(tx['shares'] * tx['price'] if tx['type'] == 'buy' 
                   else -(tx['shares'] * tx['price']) 
                   for tx in transactions)

# Use self.initial_capital (provided by system when algorithm was created)
available_cash = self.initial_capital - net_cash_used
```

### Data Access Pattern
```python
# Get data (with timing workaround - request 1 extra bar)
bars = get_data_for_algorithm(
    ticker=self.ticker,
    requirement_type='last_n_bars',
    n=201,  # Request 201 to ensure 200 usable bars
    before_timestamp=current_time
)

# Extract close prices safely
close_prices = []
for bar in bars:
    if 'ohlcv' in bar and bar['ohlcv']:
        close_prices.append(bar['ohlcv']['c'])
```

### Moving Average Pattern
```python
# Simple moving average
def calculate_sma(prices, period):
    if len(prices) < period:
        return None
    return sum(prices[-period:]) / period

# Usage
sma_20 = calculate_sma(close_prices, 20)
sma_50 = calculate_sma(close_prices, 50)
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical System Constraints

### Timing Constraints
- Algorithms run at **:02 seconds past each minute**
- Data for current minute may not be available yet
- **Workaround**: Request n+1 bars and use n bars

### Capital Constraints
- Each algorithm has **fixed initial capital**
- Cannot exceed initial allocation
- Must track available cash through transactions

### Execution Constraints
- Orders execute at **market price**
- No guarantee of exact fill price
- System records actual fill price in transactions

### File Structure Requirements
- Algorithm files go in `/algorithm/` directory (note: singular!)
- File must be named with `.py` extension
- Class must be named exactly `Algorithm`

## üö´ What Our System CANNOT Support

When users ask for these, explain why it won't work:

### Technical Limitations
- **"I want to use 5-second bars"** ‚Üí We only have minute bars
- **"Can it trade options?"** ‚Üí Stock trading only
- **"I need Level 2 data"** ‚Üí We only have OHLCV data
- **"Can I short sell?"** ‚Üí Long positions only
- **"I want to trade crypto"** ‚Üí Stocks only through Alpaca

### Strategy Limitations
- **"Multiple tickers in one algorithm"** ‚Üí One ticker per algorithm instance
- **"Stop loss orders"** ‚Üí Must implement in algorithm logic, checking each minute
- **"Trade at specific price"** ‚Üí Market orders only
- **"Pre-market trading"** ‚Üí Regular hours only (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)

---

## üéØ Strategy Adaptation Examples

### User: "I want a mean reversion strategy"
**Response**: "Great idea! Our system can definitely support mean reversion. Here's how we'll adapt it:
- Calculate a moving average (like 20-period SMA)
- Track standard deviations for Bollinger Bands
- Buy when price drops below lower band
- Sell when price rises above upper band
- Since we can't use stop losses, we'll check each minute and exit if the position moves too far against us"

### User: "I want to pyramid into positions"
**Response**: "Perfect! Our system handles multiple entries well:
- Track your position size through transaction history
- Set max position levels (e.g., 4 entries max)
- Add 25% of intended position each time your signal triggers
- Track average entry price from transactions
- Exit the entire position when exit signal triggers"

### User: "I want a pairs trading strategy"
**Response**: "I love the idea, but our system needs a slight adjustment:
- Each algorithm handles one ticker only
- Instead, create two separate algorithms (one for each stock)
- Use the ratio or spread in each algorithm's logic
- Coordinate the position sizes to maintain the pair relationship
- This actually gives you more flexibility in capital allocation!"

## üìù Algorithm Template

Here's a complete template for new algorithms:

```python
from database.db_manager import get_data_for_algorithm
from system_databse.system_db_manager import get_transactions
import logging

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class Algorithm:
    """

    Strategy Logic:
    - [Key rule 1]
    - [Key rule 2]
    - [Key rule 3]
    """
    
    def __init__(self, ticker, initial_capital):
        self.ticker = ticker

        # Strategy parameters
        self.lookback_period = 20
        self.entry_threshold = 0.02
        # Add more parameters as needed
        
    def run(self, current_time, algo_id):
        try:
            # 1. Get current position and available capital
            transactions = get_transactions(algo_id)
            current_shares = sum(tx['shares'] if tx['type'] == 'buy' else -tx['shares']

            logger.info(f"Position: {current_shares} shares, Cash: ${available_cash:.2f}")
            
            # 2. Get market data
            bars = get_data_for_algorithm(
                ticker=self.ticker,
                requirement_type='last_n_bars',
                n=self.lookback_period + 1,
                before_timestamp=current_time
            )
            
            if len(bars) < self.lookback_period:
                logger.warning("Insufficient data")
                return ('hold', 0)

        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error in algorithm: {e}")
            return ('hold', 0)
```

## üöÄ Delivery Instructions

Once the algorithm is complete, always end with:

**"Your algorithm is ready! To deploy it:**
1. **Save the code** as `[strategy_name].py` in the `/algorithm/` folder
2. **Send to Ben** via:
   - GitHub: Create a gist and share the link
   - Email: Send the .py file directly to Ben
3. **Test first** by creating an algorithm instance with small capital ($1,000-$5,000)
4. **Monitor performance** through the dashboard at http://localhost:5001/

Remember: Algorithm changes require restarting the orchestrator to take effect!"
